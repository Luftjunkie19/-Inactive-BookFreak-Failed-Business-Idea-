# BookFreak (‚ùåFailed Business Idea Project ‚ùå)




## What was it supposed to be ? ü§î

It was supposed to be a platform for bookreaders, something like GoodReads, but with web3 implementation and looking much more adjusted to current web-app ui standards. Unfortunately Ideas were growing, but the app state was changing only microscopically. After 2 years, I haven't even a finished product, only ideas. The project was finished in 60%, and remaining parts would be too much time consuming to implement, so I decided that it's over. I close this project, because I have to learn first.

## Screenshots from the development phases

For now I display to you the older images, as I will find time to look inside that project again, I will show you the version, I've left it. It's definitely much more neat than those below.

## Lessons Learned

- Before you code anything with longer perspective (6 month+), take some time to select the DB provider and general the stack like UI libraries, because then you seek for the packages and your project looks finally as a soup out of everything. Techincally it is nutritious, but practically don't know what is it out of.
- Don't base only on imagination and strutirize what features should this project have and write it down. Don't let the Developer Syndrom control you !
- Codebase structure matters as fuck, so take even a sheet of paper and write down the structure, before you code anything for longer time. Because as your project grows, you might be surprised, how tough will it be to assign a specific  file to an folder.
- Before you start bigger project, just make sure you have enough knowledge to face the difficulties/errors issues.
- Things you think you will finish within a week multiply at least by 1.5.
- Development !== Production and Production !== Development
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Thanks to this project I impoved my UI building skills, practiced a lot of many concepts like the functions webhooks management and more.
- I got acquainted with React and NextJS very deeply by this project.


#### Developer Syndrom - An physchological state, where you want to go straight to coding, skipping the essential things like. Selection of the tech stack.

##### Sometimes is simply good to slow down, because it will turn out you've done nothing special...What you actually expected
