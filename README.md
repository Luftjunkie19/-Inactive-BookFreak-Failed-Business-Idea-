# BookFreak

BookFreak is the first ever platform, that enables the users to update user's to update your reader's state. You can track by using bookfreak, how many books you have read, what precentage of certain book have you already read, what categories do you often read and so forth. In BookFreak you can connect with people by either messaging them directly or creating readersClub or competition, where you will be up to date who is leading the board, since the creation of the community.
## When, how and why?

BookFreak has been initialized on 15th February 2023, you might have asked now: (#Ok, so if the project build lasted so long, why does it still look kinda `shity`?). 

`The answer`

I had a lot of predicaments related to school and mental health (however it sounds) and also I did encounter unexptected occurrences like Death of my Grandfather and dormancy of my Dog.
